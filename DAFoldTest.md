# Fold Changes Test #

## Description ##

Fold change is a mathematical operation describing how much two variables differ. It is the ratio of the final value and initial value (B/A), if the final value is larger. This differs from the change between two values, which is (B − A)/A, which can be re-written as B/A − 1 in the respect that when the two values are identical the fold change is unity (100%, one-fold change is not used), while the change is nil.

```

            x = measured value; y = control value --> Fold change: x/y

```

The algorithm uses as a "measured" and "control" value the mean of the groups of samples chosen by the user.
